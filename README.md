===========

A BGE game for BGMC 9

To run the game, you can load and run src/levels/level_select.blend or use game.py.

To use game.py, the blenderplayer either needs to be in your path, or you need to copy the contents of your blender install into the same folder as game.py.
Alternatively, you can modify game.py to point to your blenderplayer.
